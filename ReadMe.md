* ### Object-Oriented Programming (Part 2)

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
* composition
* polymorphism
* encapsulation

## Composition
This has to do with the __"has-a"__ relationship instead of a __"is-a"__ relationship like in the concept of inheritance.

Creating objects of objects --> object hierarchy

## Encapsulation
This has to do with the mechanism that allows you to access restrict access to certain components in the objects that we are creating.
* authorized/unauthorized access
* private members/methods
* make internal changes without affecting code outside the subjective class.

## Polymorphism
