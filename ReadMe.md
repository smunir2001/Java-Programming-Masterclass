## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
* classes
* constructors
* inheritance
* composition
* polymorphism
* encapsulation

## Classes
To understand classes, we need to understand what are objects.
* objects have two major characteristics:
    * state:
        * a software object stores its state in fields, and we know fields as variables.
    * behavior: 
        * a software object exposes its behavior with methods.

We can think of classes as templates or blueprints for creating objects.
* classes can be thought of as a powerful way to create user-defined data types.

## Constructors
Constructors are methods with the same class name and no return type.
* they allow us to initialize new instances of objects according to available parameters and specs.

## Composition
This has to do with the __"has-a"__ relationship instead of a __"is-a"__ relationship like in the concept of inheritance.

Creating objects of objects --> object hierarchy

## Encapsulation
This has to do with the mechanism that allows you to access restrict access to certain components in the objects that we are creating.
* authorized/unauthorized access
* private members/methods
* make internal changes without affecting code outside the subjective class.

## Polymorphism
This is the OOP mechanism that gives programmers the capability to allow actions to act differently based on what object is acting.
